    "# Exercise 1 Business and Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "To reduce the number of unexpected failures and optimize maintenance intervals, large aircraft maintenance companies aim to change their maintenance models from scheduled maintenance to predictive maintenance. One important aspect of this is the assessment of the current health status of the aircraft components and the prediction of their remaining lifetime based on measured sensor data. In this exercise, we focus on the prediction of aircraft engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data contains run-to-failure simulations for different engines generated by the C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) tool which is used for the simulation of a large commercial aircraft engine. Detailed information on the generation of the data can be found in the paper \"Damage Propagation Modeling for Aircraft Engine Run-To-Failure Simulation\" by Saxena, Goebel, Simon and Eklund that we provide you in Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to estimate the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of the aircraft engines. The total exercise will be divided into three sub-tasks following the CRISP-DM model. In this week, the focus will be on the understanding of the available dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "In Moodle, you can download the file “train_FD001.txt” that contains run-to-failure curves from several engines. The dataset contains in total 26 parameters that are shown in the table below.\n",
    "For each data entry, the corresponding engine number and cycle number is given. All engines were simulated until failure, meaning that the cycle numbers reach from 1 to the end of life of the engines. Parameters 2 - 4 indicate the operating conditions that were input parameters for the simulation. The remaining parameters 5 - 25 are the simulated sensor data and therefore the output of the simulation.\n",
